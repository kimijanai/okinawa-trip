## Weather-Related Travel Tips

### Planning Your Days
- Check daily weather forecasts each morning
- Plan indoor activities for afternoons when showers are more likely
- Take advantage of clear mornings for outdoor activities
- Have your rainy day alternatives ready (as provided in your itinerary)

### Driving in Rain
- Allow extra travel time during rainy conditions
- Be cautious on mountain roads which can become slippery

### Health Considerations
- Stay hydrated (the humid climate can cause dehydration even when it doesn't feel hot)
- Take breaks in air-conditioned spaces during particularly humid days
- Watch for signs of heat exhaustion, even on cloudy days
