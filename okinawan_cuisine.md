# Okinawan Cuisine and Restaurant Recommendations

## Traditional Okinawan Dishes

### Must-Try Dishes
1. **Goya Champuru (ゴーヤーチャンプルー)** - Okinawa's signature stir-fry dish made with bitter melon, tofu, eggs, and pork. The word "champuru" means "mix" in the Okinawan dialect.

2. **Okinawa Soba (沖縄そば)** - Unlike mainland Japanese soba, Okinawan soba uses wheat noodles in a pork-based broth, topped with stewed pork belly (rafute), fish cake, and green onions.

3. **Rafute (ラフテー)** - Tender pork belly simmered in soy sauce, brown sugar, and awamori (Okinawan rice liquor). This melt-in-your-mouth dish is a staple at Okinawan celebrations.

4. **Taco Rice (タコライス)** - A fusion dish created in the 1960s near American military bases. It combines taco fillings (seasoned ground beef, lettuce, tomato, cheese) served over rice instead of a taco shell.

5. **Umibudo (海ぶどう)** - Known as "sea grapes" or "green caviar," these are small, edible seaweed that pop in your mouth like caviar. Usually served with ponzu sauce.

6. **Ishigaki Beef (石垣牛)** - Premium wagyu beef from Ishigaki Island, known for its marbling and tenderness.

7. **Soki Soba (ソーキそば)** - A variation of Okinawa soba that features pork spare ribs (soki) as the main topping.

8. **Jimami Tofu (ジーマミー豆腐)** - Peanut tofu, a unique Okinawan dessert made from peanut milk instead of soybeans. It has a sweet, nutty flavor.

9. **Mozuku (モズク)** - A type of seaweed served in vinegar, often as an appetizer. It's known for its slimy texture and health benefits.

10. **Sata Andagi (サーターアンダギー)** - Okinawan donuts, slightly crispy on the outside and cake-like on the inside. The name means "deep-fried sugar" in the Okinawan dialect.

### Local Beverages
1. **Awamori (泡盛)** - Okinawa's traditional distilled rice liquor, often aged for many years. (Not recommended with children, but worth knowing about)

2. **Sanpin Tea (さんぴん茶)** - Jasmine tea that's commonly served with meals in Okinawa.

3. **Shikuwasa Juice (シークヮーサージュース)** - Made from a local citrus fruit similar to lime, refreshing and rich in vitamin C.
